# Real Time Bus Tracker

## **Description:**
This is week nine's JavaScript project to track buses on a Boston city map using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used mapboxgl open source platform which allowed me to create and display the map; mapboxgl JavaScript library is part of the Mapbox package. It allowed me to add customizations to the map, such as the markers at specific locations that represent a bus route.

In this activity, I used the Boston MBTA bus data to determine stops between Harvard University and MIT. I then customized it by adding the animated marker to map the bus routes.

## **How to Run the Program:**
First install the files. To install, please download the files to your laptop.  To execute, drag index.html onto your browser's URL window.

## **Roadmap of Future Improvements:**
The plan for improving this program includes the following:
- Using an actual bus icon to represent the buses on the map
- Finding and using public data from a different city, preferably a major foreign city such as London, UK
- Examining other public data that I could integrate on this map, such as hospital locations.
