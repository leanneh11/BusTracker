# Real Time Bus Tracker

**Description:**
This is week nine's JavaScript project to track buses on a Boston city map using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used mapboxgl open source platform which allowed me to create and display the map; mapboxgl JavaScript library is part of the Mapbox package. It allowed me to add customizations to the map, such as the markers at specific locations that represent a bus route.

In this activity, I used the Boston MBTA bus data to determine stops between Harvard University and MIT. I then customized it by adding the animated marker to map the bus routes.
